# recursion-llm
This is a project where I study llm-s and try to train one.<br>
I have taken a lot of inspiration from [modded nanogpt](https://github.com/KellerJordan/modded-nanogpt).<br>
My goal is to make a somewhat optimised training setup and then try to find modifications that improve the model's learning efficiency.
